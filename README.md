HitboxTextureToHitbox is suited for every format, it searches for all rectangles within a spritesheet's certain sequence, the rectangles have to be pixel perfect, it outputs the x, y, width and height of each rectangle of each frame of each animation sequence, you just have to run it in an editor while inputting your file location, the sequence of animation you want to convert(y axis on image), and the individual split size of your spritesheet
TiledToJsonRoom converts tiled exported json rooms to my Rienet Engine's (or actually Atelo, a game I'm working on specifically) format, I don't recommend using it but you can kinda follow its logic.
